# Predicting Heart Disease
### Project Synopsis
This project was developed during my first year as a Software Engineering student for the Computer Programming II course. It serves as an introductory exploration of machine learning concepts and their practical application in data analysis.
Rather than focusing on achieving high prediction accuracy or producing polished visualizations, the primary objective of this project was to understand how data-driven approaches can reveal meaningful patterns and insights, even when working with limited or imperfect data.
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with the end-to-end workflow of a machine learning task, including data preprocessing, feature analysis, model training, and result interpretation. Additionally, the project provided valuable insight into the medical factors that influence heart disease, helping bridge theoretical programming knowledge with a real-world health-related problem.

## Medical Scope

This project aims to predict heart diseases based on some factors like:
- Age
- Sex
- Blood pressure
- Cholestrol
- Fasting blood surgar
- EKG results
- Maximum heart rate
- Exercise angina
- ST depression
- Slope of ST
- Number of vessels floru
- Thallium

This project was developed and run on Google Colab. Check "PredictingHeartDisease_Report.pdf" to see the analysis done and the code structure explanations. 

Each letter signifies a sepearte code block to be run in the same order described.
For the first (a) section, use the file named _"Heart Disease Predicition.csv"_.

The final model achieved an accuracy of **0.7**, which was considered acceptable given the educational focus of the project and the goal of understanding model behavior rather than optimization.
